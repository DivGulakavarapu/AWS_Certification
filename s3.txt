Simple Storage Service
S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.

It is not for OS or DBMS

The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

There is unlimited storage.

Bucket ~ Folder

S3 is a universal namesapce. That is, names must be unique globally.
e.g https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru

2- Data Model Consistency

Read after Write Consistency- as soon as you upload it is available.

Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES.

S3 is a simple key, value store.
S3 supports version control.

S3 Object Anatomy {
    key
    value
    version ID
    MetaData
    Subresources -  bucket specific configuration. (CORS and Bucket Policies)
}


Built for 99.99% availability for s3 platform
Amazon Guarentees 99.9% availability
Amazon Guarentees 99.999999999 (11 9's) of durability.
It is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.


S3- Storage Tiers/Classes [check image]
 1. s3 (Standard)
 2. S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, 
 but requires rapid access when needed.
 3. S3- One Zone IA: Same as IA however data is stored in a single availability Zone only,
  still 99.999999999 durability, but only 99.5% availability.
  Cost is 20% less than regular S3-IA
4. Reduced Redundancy Storage: Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a guven year.
Used for data that can be recreated if lost, e.g thumbnails. (Starting to disappear from AWS documentation but may still feature in exam)
5. Glacier: Very Cheap, but used for archival only. Optimised for data that is infrequently accessed.


Lifecycle Management
Versioning
Encryption

Charges
1. Storage per GB 
2. Requests (GET PUT etc)
3. Storage Management pricing. Inventory, analytics etc
4. Data Managment pricing i.e downloading file (data transfeered out of s3)
5. Transfer Acceleration (Use of cloudfront to optimize transfers)

Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.

S3-Security

By Default all buckets are PRIVATE.

You can set up access control to your buckets using:
 Bucket Policies - Applied at bucket level.
 Access Control Lists - Applied at Object Level.
S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs, which log all requests made to the s3 bucket.
These logs can be written to another bucket.
Bucket Policy are written in JSON.


LAB (S3 Policy etc)

2 encrypiton is offerred AES-256 and AWS-KMS

1.In-Transit:
SSL/TLS (HTTPS)

2.At-REST 
Server Side Encryption:
 S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 
 AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys, SSE-KMS 
 Server Side Encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C 

3.Client Side Encryption 

If you want to enforce the use of encryption for oyur files stored in S3, use an S3 Bucket Policy
to deny all PUT requests that don't include the x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header.

Every time a file is uploaded a PUT request is initiated.

In AWS key names determine which partition the object(file) is stored in - you could add a hax prefix to file name for better performance.

GET-Intensive Workloads : Use CloudFront

Mixed Workloads (GET, PUT & DELETE) : Use hax prefix to S3 object key names to prevent multiple objects being stored on the same partition.
