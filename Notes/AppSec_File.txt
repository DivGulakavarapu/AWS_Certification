The Appspec file is used to define the parameters that will be used for a CodeDeploy deployment. The file structure depends on whether you are deploying to Lambda or EC2/on premise instance

For Lambda Deployments the file can be written in YAML or JSON.
They contain the following fields:

1.resources : The name and properties of the Lambda function to deploy
2.version: Reserved for future use - currently the only allowed value is 0.0
3.hooks: specifies Lambda function to run at a certain time in the process etc.
There are two hooks allowed:

BeforeAllowTraffic: used to specify the task and function that needs to be excuted before the traffic is routed to the new lambda function

e.g test validating deployment

AfterAllowTraffic : used to specify the task and function that needs to be excuted after the traffic is routed to the new lambda function

e.g validation tests for traffc analaysis

------------------------
FOR EC2
------------------------

1. version: Reserved for future use - currently the only allowed value is 0.0
2. OS: The name of the operating system you are using.
3. Files: source and destination folder.
4. Hooks: scripts that need to run at set point in the deployment lifecycle.
(e.g) Unzip files prior to deployment lifecycle, run functional tests.


yml file only for this thang.

Question. The deployment is failing. What could be the reason?
The appsec.yml file is not placed in the root of the directory revision where all the application code is.

Hooks:

Application Stop: Gracefully stop the application in preparation for deploying the new revision.

Download Bundle: The Code Deploy agent copies the file to a temporary location.

BeforeInstall: Details of any installation script, backing up current revision, decrypting files

Install: The code deploy agent copies the file from temporary location to correct location

AfterInstall: Details of any post application scripts e.g configuration tasks, change file permission.

ApplicationStart: restart any services that were stopped during ApplicationStop

ValidateService: Details of any test to validate the service

Then these 3 final hooks are executed for re-registering. They are also executed before beginning.


BeforeBlockTraffic: Run Tasks on instances before they are deregistered from a load balancer
BlockTraffic: Deregister instances from a load balancer
AfterBlockTraffic: Run tasks on instances after they are deregistered from a load balancer
