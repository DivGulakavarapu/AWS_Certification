CI & CD

Code repository -> Build Management System -> Test FrameWork


Multiple Developers working in on different features or bug fixes.
All contributing to the same application.
Sharing the same code repository.
Frequently pushing their updates into the shared repo- at least daily.

Code Repository integrated with a build management system. Code Changes trigger an automated build

We need a way to ensure that any code changes does not break the build or intorduce new bugs in the application.

The test system runs automated tests on the newly built application

Identifies any bugs, preventing issues from being introduced in the master code

CI focuses on small code changes which frequently committed into the main repository once they have been successfully tested.

------------------------------------
CD: Continous Delivery/ Deployment
------------------------------------

Continous Delivery is a development practice where merged changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release into staging and eventually production environments.

There is usually a manual decision to deploy.


---------------------------------------

Continous Deployment takes the idea of automation one step further and automatically deploys the new code following successful testing, eliminating manual steps.

The new code is automatically released as soon as it passes through the stages of your release process(build, test, package)

Basically Continous Deployment also automate the release process as well.

AWS Services:  [AWS Code Commit - > AWS CodeBuild -> AWS CodeDeploy] CodePipeline

CodeCommit - source code control
CodeBuild - compile source code, run tests and package code
Code Deploy -
AWS  CodePipeline - CI/CD workflow tool that fully automates the entire release process.


AWS CodeCommit -> 1.based on git. central repo for all code binaries etc. Tracks and manages code changes. Maintains version history. Manages updates from multiple sources enables collaboration. 
Data is encrypted in transit or at rest.



Code Deploy

It is an automated deployments service which allows you to deploy your application code automatically yo EC2 instances, on-premises systems and lambda functions.

Allows you to quickly release new features, avoid downtime during application deployments, and avoid downtime during application deployments, and avoid the risks associated with manual processes.

It integrates with various CI/CD tools such as jenkins, Github, Atlasssian, AWS CodePipeline as well as config management tools such as chef, puppet, Ansible
Two different deployment approaches available:
In-Place and Blue/Green


In-Place: Application is stopped and then new version is installed. You can also use ELB to stop sending requests to it.
also known is rolling feature.

drawbacks
Not supported for lambda, only for EC-2 and on-premise systems

If you need to roll back rededploy prev version



Blue Green: Just route back the traffic to new server

blue: active
green: new release

Deployment Group - A set of EC2 instances or Lambda functions to which a new revision of the software is to be deployed.
Deployment - The process and components used to apply a new revision.
Deployment Configuration - A set of deployment rules as well as success/failure conditions used during a deployment.
AppSec File - Defines the deployment actions you want AWS CodeDeploy to execute.
Revision - Everything needed to deploy new version: Appsec File, applications file, executables, config files
Appliaction - Unique identifier for the application you want to deploy. To ensure the correct Combination of revision, deployment configuration and deployment group are referenced during a deployment.

CodePipeline 101

AWS CodePipeLine is a fully managed Continous Integration and Delivery Service.

CodePipeline can orchestrate the Build, Test, and even Deployment of your application every time there is a change to your code - all based on a user defined software release process.

Traditional manual approaches to code delivery can be slow and prone to errors, whereas an automated process allows developers to frequently release new features and bug fixes in a fast and reliable way.

It itnegrates with CodeCommit, deploy, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, ClouFormation, ECS as well as third party tools like Github and Jenkins. 


Using Code Pipeline you can deploy to EC2, Lambda and On-Premise System.

CodePipeLine Lab

Use CodePipeLine to Deploy your code to a set of ec2 instances.

There are three deployment style
one at a time
half at a time 
all at a time

Q)Which of the following is the right sequence of hooks that get called in AWS CodeDeploy?
Q) Code Deploy Instance Profile

Create a service role for AWS CodeDeploy
n AWS, service roles are used to grant permissions to an AWS service so it can access AWS resources.
The policies that you attach to the service role determine which AWS resources the service can access and what it can do with those resources.

For EC2 AWSCodeDeployRole
For ECS AWSCodeDeployRoleForEC2
For Lambda AWSCodeDeployRoleForLambda

Code instance Profile only for EC2
If you are using the Amazon ECS or AWS Lambda compute platform , skip this step. Amazon ECS deployments deploy an Amazon ECS service, and AWS Lambda deployments deploy a serverless Lambda function version, so an instance profile for Amazon EC2 instances is not required.

Youâ€™re planning on using the AWS CodeDeploy tool for deployment of your application. Which of the following is used to specify how your application will be deployed to the underlying instances?
