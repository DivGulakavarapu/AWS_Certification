Virtual Private Network

## THEORY ##
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.
It is an isolated portion of the AWS cloud populated by AWS objects, such as Amazon EC2 instances.
Can span multiple AZ, but can’t span multiple regions, PEER VPC, but no Transitive Peering.
When you create Custom VPC it creates default security group, default network ACL and default route table, it doesn’t create default Subnet.

- Inside this you get the Subnet which is firewalled by ACL.
- Each subnet has EC-2 instanes.
- Each subnet must be within one AZ. It can't span AZ.
- You must specify an IPv4 address range for your VPC.
- Specify the IPv4 address range as a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.
- You cannot specify an IPv4 CIDR block larger than /16. You can optionally associate an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block with the VPC.
- Each Amazon account comes with a default VPC where in all your ec2-instances etc is launched.
- VPC can span multiple availability zones in the region.
- Default VPC 12.31.0.0/16 will provide about 65536 IP Addresses
- Subnets are required to launch instances into VPCs.
- One Subnet == one AZ, you can have security group spanning multiple AZ, ACL’s span across AZ (assign sg and ACL to two different subnets)

Three Addresses are associated with VPC:
Public IP address
Private IP address
Elastic IP address (They remian in your account until you choose to release it)

SUBNET
- A range of IP Addresses in your VPC; you can launch AWS resources into a subnet that you select.
- Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the interet.
- Per subnet around 4000 connections.
- A subnet is always mapped to a single availability zone.
- any CIDR block 5 reserved IPs (.0, .1, .2, .3, .255)
- so for CIRD block /24: 2^8 - 5 = 256 - 5 = 251 available IP address space

INTERNET GATEWAY
- Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
- It therefore imposes no avaiability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.
- Basically  Internet Gateway allows VPC to connect to internet.
- When you create internet gateway, by default its detached, attach it to VPC then, only 1 IGW per VPC

ROUTE TABLE
- Each Subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table and only one route table but the route table can be asoociated with multiple subnets.
- When you create a VPC Default Routetable(Main Routable) is created where the default Routes are, 10.0.0.0/16 Local <— all subnets inside VPC will be able to talk to each other
- Don’t touch Main route table.
- Create another routetable for route out to internet (0.0.0.0/0 IGW) <— route out to the internet
- Last thing you associate this new route table to one of the subnet which will make it public. (you can enable auto assign public IP for the public subnet)
- 1 subnet can have 1 routetable

VPC FLOWLOGS
- To capture all the traffic information into logs - logs everything (create IAM role and create cloud watch log group - and log stream) [Question]

NAT GATEWAY
- NAT gateway - released in 2016 - amazon handled
- You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. 
- You are charged for creating and using a NAT gateway in your account. 
- Do not support IPv6 address.
- Only associates with Elastic IP Address. The Elastic IP address cannot be changed once you associate it with the NAT Gateway.
- Deleting a NAT gateway disassociates its Elastic IP address, but does not release the address from your account.
- A NAT gateway supports the following protocols: TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
- You cannot associate a security group with a NAT gateway.
- You cannot route traffic to a NAT gateway through a VPC peering connection, a Site-to-Site VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect.
- GATEWAY VPC ENDPOINT. To avoid data processing charges for NAT gateways when accessing Amazon S3 and DynamoDB, set up a gateway endpoint and route the traffic through the gateway endpoint instead of the NAT gateway.
- You can just create the gateway and assign EIP (put it in public subnet) (automatically assigned)
- Change the main route table - add a route (0.0.0.0/0 NAT gateway target)
- No need for disable source/destination check or no need to put it behind a security group - it handles it for you.
- Highly available / redundancy no need for ASG.NAT gateways are little bit costly - always use it in production scale automatically up to 10Gbps

NAT INSTANCES 
- You can use a network address translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the Internet
- NAT Instance - disable source / destination check., always behind security group, must be in public subnet, must have an EIP, ,must be a route out of the private subnet to NAT
- Increase the instance size if bottleneck
- Change the main route table - add a route (0.0.0.0/0 NAT Instance target)
- NAT Instance is a single point of failover (put it behind a ASG)
- NAT instances can "Use an Elastic IP address or a public IP address."

A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection
USE CASE: You want to connect to a Private s3 bucket. Create a VPC endpoint.

## QUESTIONS ##

Q) When can you delete VPC?
Can’t delete VPC if you have active running instance or ELB is running.
