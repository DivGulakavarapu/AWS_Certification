Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, code running on AWS Lambda, or any web application.

What can API Gateway Do?

Expose HTTPS endpoints to define a restful API
Serverless-ly conect to services like Lambda & DynamoDB
Send each API endpoint to a different target.
Run efficiently with low cost
Scale Effortlessly
Track and control usage by API key
Throttle requests to prevent attacks
Maintain multiple version of the API


API Caching

You can enable API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoints response. With Caching, you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of the requests to your API. When you enable caching for a stage, API gateway caches responses from your endpoint for a specified time to live (TTL) period, in seconds. API Gateway then responds to the request by looking up the endpoint response from the cache instead of making a request to your endpoint.
