AWS Relational DataBase Service

## THEORY ##
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.
These are the database types that we can provision:
1. SQL Server
2. Oracle
3. MySQL Server
4. PostgreSQL
5. Aurora (Amazon's Own)
6. MariaDB
- RedShift is used for OLAP. 
- Amazon Aurora Serverless: is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora (MySQL-compatible edition), where the database will automatically start up, shut down, and scale capacity up or down based on your application's needs.

MULTI AZ DEPLOYMENTS AND READ REPLICASS
- It is used only for RDS.
- Multi-AZ for durability and read replicas for scaliability.
- MULTI AZ is for disaster recovery only.
- If you want performance improvement, you need read Replicas.
- Read Replicas can be in dfiference region and availability zones.
- But they are not availabile for SQL Server or Aurora. 

RDS BACKUPS
There are two types of backups.
    1. Automated Backups
    - Automated Backups allow you to recover your database to any point in time within a "retention period".
    - The retention period can be between one and 35 days. 
    - Automated Backups will take a full daily snapshot and will also store transaction logs throughout the day. 
    - This allows you to do a point in time recovery down to a second, within the retention period.
    - Enabled by default and is stored on s3 for free.
    - If I have 10gb RDS I get 10gb S3 size for free.
    2. DataBase Snapshots.
    - Snapshots are done manually and are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance, unlike automated backups.
    - Encrypting an existing database is not supported now.
    - If a Rest endpoint is encrypted, the underlying storage is encrypted.
