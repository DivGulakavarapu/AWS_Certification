CloudFront
For web distributions, to control how long your objects stay in a CloudFront cache before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin, 
you can configure your origin to add a Cache-Control or an Expires header field to each object.
Specify a value for Minimum TTL in CloudFront cache behaviors.·Use the default value of 24 hours.

AWS X-RAY

AWS Lambda uses environment variables to facilitate communication with the X-Ray daemon and configure the X-Ray SDK.
_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID: Contains the tracing header, which includes the sampling decision, trace ID, and parent segment ID. If Lambda receives a tracing header when your function is invoked, that header will be used to populate the _X_AMZN_TRACE_ID environment variable. If a tracing header was not received, Lambda will generate one for you.· AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING: The X-Ray SDK uses this variable to determine its behavior in the event that your function tries to record X-Ray data, but a tracing header is not available. Lambda sets this value to LOG_ERROR by default.· AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: This environment variable exposes the X-Ray daemon's address in the following format: IP_ADDRESS:PORT.
You can use the X-Ray daemon's address to send trace data to the X-Ray daemon directly, without using the X-Ray SDK.

AWS DATA PIPELINE
