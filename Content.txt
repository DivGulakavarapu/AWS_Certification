Some Essential Tips:
DO Practice Tests on AWS Cloud Guru and other sites.
Lookout for scenario based questions.
Confirm big focus on DynamoDB (~15/55 questions) and S3 (~12/55 questions)
Attempt all questions as there are no negative marks.
If you have a long question, read the full question once and then only re read the last one or two lines as the real question lies there.
Practise the art of elimination! Eliminate the options that you are sure are not correct.
