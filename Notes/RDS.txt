AWS Relational DataBase Service

## THEORY ##
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.
These are the database types that we can provision:
1. SQL Server
2. Oracle
3. MySQL Server
4. PostgreSQL
5. Aurora (Amazon's Own)
6. MariaDB
- RedShift is used for OLAP. 
- Amazon Aurora Serverless: is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora (MySQL-compatible edition), where the database will automatically start up, shut down, and scale capacity up or down based on your application's needs.

MULTI AZ DEPLOYMENTS AND READ REPLICASS
- It is used only for RDS.
- Multi-AZ for durability and read replicas for scalability.
- MULTI AZ is for disaster recovery only.
- If you want performance improvement, you need read Replicas.
- Read Replicas can be in different region and availability zones.
- But they are not availabile for SQL Server or Aurora. 

RDS BACKUPS
There are two types of backups.
    1. Automated Backups
    - Automated Backups allow you to recover your database to any point in time within a "retention period".
    - The retention period can be between one and 35 days. 
    - Automated Backups will take a full daily snapshot and will also store transaction logs throughout the day. 
    - This allows you to do a point in time recovery down to a second, within the retention period.
    - Enabled by default and is stored on s3 for free.
    - If I have 10gb RDS I get 10gb S3 size for free.
    2. DataBase Snapshots.
    - Snapshots are done manually and are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance, unlike automated backups.
    - Encrypting an existing database is not supported now.
    - If a Rest endpoint is encrypted, the underlying storage is encrypted.

CONNECTING TO RDS INSTANCE
- Get the endpoint of instance from DB Admin.
- Use DescribeDBInstances to get the 
- The maximum number of connections allowed to an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance is based on the amount of memory available for the DB instance class of the DB instance.
- The connection limit for a DB instance is set by default to the maximum for the DB instance class for the DB instance. You can limit the number of concurrent connections to any value up to the maximum number of connections allowed using the max_connections parameter in the parameter group for the DB instance.
- Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate for your DB instance when the instance is created. If you enable SSL certificate verification, then the SSL certificate includes the DB instance endpoint as the Common Name (CN) for the SSL certificate to guard against spoofing attacks.
- To connect to your DB instance using SSL, you can use native password authentication or IAM database authentication

LOGS IN RDS
- General Error logs
- Slow Query logs
- Query logs
