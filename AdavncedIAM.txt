Users can sign in diretly to the user pool, or indirectlt via an identity provider like Facebook, Amazon or Google. Cognito acts as an identity broker between the ID provider and AWS. Successful authnetication generates a number of JWTs

Identity pools enable you to create unique identities for your users and authentiate them with identity providers. With an identity, you can obtain temporary, limited privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services.

AWS Cognito uses sth called Push Synchronization to provide seamless experience.
It pushes the update silently using SNS whenever data is changed.
