Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

It reduces time to obatain a new server and boot to minutes thus reduces time to scale very easily.

EC2- options

1.On Demand - allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment.

    -> Perfect for users that want the low cost and flexibility without up front payment or long term commitment.
    -> Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
    -> Applications being develped or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

2.Reserved - provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a siginificant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year terms.
    -> Applications with steady state or predictable usage
    -> Applications that require reserved capacity
    -> Users can make up front payments to reduce the cost even further.
    -> Standard RIs
    -> Convertible RIs
    -> Scheduled RIs (scale it on a particular day)

3.Spot - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
    -> Applications that have flexible start and end times
    -> Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    -> Users with an urgent need for large computational capacity(Genome etc)

4.Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server bound software licenses.
   -> Useful for licenses that doesn't support cloud virtulization etc.

Note: Some Windows or Linux AMIs carry with them an additional hourly charge from the provider instead of secondly


EC-2 Instance type types

F1 Field Programmable Gate Array | Genomic Research, real time video processing
I3 High Speed Storage
G3 Graphics intensive | Video Encoding and shit
H1 High Disk Throughput | Map Reduce based workloads

T2 Lowest Cost, General Purpose | Web Servers/ small DBs

D2 Dense Storage | file servers/ Data wwarehousing

R4 \ Memory Optimized | memory intensive Apps/DBs

M5 General Purpose | Application servers

C5 Compute Optimized | CPU Intensive Apps/DBs

P3 Gen | machine Learning, Bit Coin Mining etc

X1 Memory Optimized | SAP HANA/Apache Spark etc (Huge Amount of RAMs)

The Alphabet remains the same. It represents the family. T2 might change to T3. Remember the letter not the number.


F - for FPGA
I - IOPS
G - Graphics
H - High Disk Throughput
T - cheap general purpose
D - Density
R - RAM
M - main choice general purpose apps
C - compute
P - Graphics
X - Extreme Memory


What is EBS??

Elastic Block Storage

An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to a single EC2 instance.
EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance. After a volume is attached to an instance, you can use it like any other physical hard drive.
You can create file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS are placed in a specific availbility zone where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

EBS Volume Types

1. SSD

1.1 General Purpose SSD(GP2)
- General purpose, balances both price and performance.
-ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods
[exam question] An EBS need with less than 10,000 IOPS. ans->GP2

1.2 Provisioned IOPS SSD
-Good for Big, NOSQL Databases
[question] for the above use case. can provision upto 20,000 IOPS per volume.


2. Magnetic
2.1 Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
 - Big Data
 - Data Warehouses
 - Log Processing
 - Cannot be a boot volume

2.2 Cold HDD (SC1)
-Lowest Cost Storage designed for less frequently accessed workloads.

2.3 Magnetic
-Lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types that is bootable.
previous generation.

EC2 Exam tips

-4 demand pricing types

[Important] If a spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate it yourself, you will be charged for the complete hour in which the instance ran.
