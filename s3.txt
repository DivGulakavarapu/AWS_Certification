Simple Storage Service

(12 question at the least)

S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.

It is not for OS or DBMS.

The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

There is unlimited storage.

Bucket ~ Folder

It is object based storage.

S3 is a universal namesapce. That is, names must be unique globally.
e.g https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru

2- Data Model Consistency

Read after Write Consistency- as soon as you upload it is available.

Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES.

S3 is a simple key, value store.
S3 supports version control.

S3 Object Anatomy {
    key
    value
    version ID
    MetaData
    Subresources -  bucket specific configuration. (CORS and Bucket Policies)
}


Built for 99.99% availability for s3 platform
Amazon Guarentees 99.9% availability
Amazon Guarentees 99.999999999 (11 9's) of durability.
It is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.


S3- Storage Tiers/Classes [check image]
 1. s3 (Standard)
 2. S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, 
 but requires rapid access when needed.
 3. S3- One Zone IA: Same as IA however data is stored in a single availability Zone only,
  still 99.999999999 durability, but only 99.5% availability.
  Cost is 20% less than regular S3-IA
4. Reduced Redundancy Storage: Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year.
Used for data that can be recreated if lost, e.g thumbnails. (Starting to disappear from AWS documentation but may still feature in exam)
5. Glacier: Very Cheap, but used for archival only. Optimised for data that is infrequently accessed.


Lifecycle Management
Versioning
Encryption

They key name decides in which partition the file is stored in.
Charges
1. Storage per GB 
2. Requests (GET PUT etc)
3. Storage Management pricing. Inventory, analytics etc
4. Data Managment pricing i.e downloading file (data transfeered out of s3)
5. Transfer Acceleration (Use of cloudfront to optimize transfers)

Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.

S3-Security

By Default all buckets are PRIVATE.

You can set up access control to your buckets using:
 Bucket Policies - Applied at bucket level.
 Access Control Lists - Applied at Object Level.
S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs, which log all requests made to the s3 bucket.
These logs can be written to another bucket.
Bucket Policy are written in JSON.


LAB (S3 Policy etc)

2 encrypiton is offerred AES-256 and AWS-KMS

1.In-Transit:
SSL/TLS (HTTPS)

2.At-REST 
Server Side Encryption:
 S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 
 AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys, SSE-KMS 
 Server Side Encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C 

3.Client Side Encryption 

If you want to enforce the use of encryption for oyur files stored in S3, use an S3 Bucket Policy
to deny all PUT requests that don't include the x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header.

Every time a file is uploaded a PUT request is initiated.


CORS - Configuration LAB (pending)[do it. Made mistakes in the question] 


CloudFront

CDN: A content delivery network is a system of distributed servers that 
Basically helps you reduce network latency and hops.

Edge Locations used by Cloud Front to keep copies of cache file which is much closer to the geographihc location.

origin: This is the origin of all the files the CDN will distribute, which can be an s3 bucket, an ec2 instance an elastic load balancer,route53 or elastic load balancer.

Distribution is a collection of edge locations
1. Web Distribution - Typically used for websites.HTTP, HTTPS
2. RTMP- Protocol used for Media Streaming


What is CloudFront?

Amazon CloudFront can be used to deliver your entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content using a  global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge locations, so the content is delivered with the best possible performance.

e.g Can be used to be used to optimize performance for users accessing a website backed by s3.

ClouFront works with s3, route53, ec2 and also with non aws server

Objects are cached for TTL value. The Time to Live value expires, cached object is deleted.

You can clear cached objects but you will be charged.


Create Distribution:

1. Improve your loading speed by creating a cloudfront and serve some images nigga
2.
3.

S3 performance update

3500 put operations
5500 get operations

What is hex hash prefix in s3?

At a time you can upload a max of 5GB. Use multipart upload if the file size is greater than that bruh.
