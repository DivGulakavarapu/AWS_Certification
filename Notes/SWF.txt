AWS Simpe Workflow Service 

## THEORY ##
Amazon SWF helps developers build, run, and scale background jobs that have parallel or sequential steps.

Workers - interact with SWF to get task, process received task and return the result

Deciders - program that co-ordinates the tasks, i.e. - ordering, concurrency and scheduling

Workers and Deciders can run independently.

TASK is only assigned ONCE and NEVER DUPLICATED (key difference from SQS where messages can be processed multiple times)

SWF Domain - think of it as a container for the work flow. you can register a domain by Console or API.
