The above quote is what motivated me to create this repository. This repository aims to explain the must have concepts of JavaScript in a simplified manner.

## ForeWord
Focus on the learning and certification will follow. Certification should never be the Target.  Your ability to comprehend and apply those learnings should be.

## Practical Affinity 

1. Create IAM user, their setting etc
2. Create an S3 bucket, add some shit etc.
